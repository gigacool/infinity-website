    "founder_story_p1": "I've always believed learning should feel like real progress — not checking boxes or chasing certificates. But when I looked at what was available, I saw a gap: the tools weren't built for how we actually learn.",
    "founder_story_p2": "So I went to the source. The science of memory, motivation, and habits reveals techniques that genuinely work — spaced repetition, active recall, deliberate practice. Proven, powerful, and barely used by anyone.",
